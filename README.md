# OpenZeppelin Contributor License Agreement

OpenZeppelin requires all contributors to its repositories licensed under GPL licenses to first sign its Contributor License Agreement, or "CLA". This repo is used to implement the CLA assistant to automate that process. If you have any questions about the CLA or this process, please reach out to legal@openzeppelin.com

## How to use

* Please review the OpenZeppelin [Contribution License Agreement](openzeppelin_2025_cla.md) in order to acknowledge and agree to the terms under which you may contribute to OpenZeppelin projects.
